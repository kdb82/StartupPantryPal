### Elevator pitch

PantryPal is a social recipe-sharing application designed to reduce food waste and decision fatigue by helping users cook with ingredients they already have. The application combines pantry tracking, social media chat functionality, and an AI-powered assistant chef to recommend recipes tailored to user preferences and available ingredients in their own pantry. Real-time features allow users to interact with friends through shared recipes, group chats, an automated shopping list, and polls to find the answer for the hardest question: what's for dinner tonight?

### Design

![Design image](placeholder.png)

The application is designed around four primary views:
1. Pantry View – Manage ingredients currently available in your pantry.
2. Feed & Recipes View – View recipes saved by followed users.
3. AI assistant - Generate recipe ideas using the ingredients in your pantry.
4. Planning View – Shopping list and meal calendar that automatically update based on saved recipes.
